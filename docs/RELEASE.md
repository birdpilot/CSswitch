# Release gates

Passing a lower layer never implies a higher layer passed.

1. **Source:** focused unit/static tests, Rust tests where the environment permits, clippy, and `git diff --check`.
2. **Artifact:** build the intended app/sidecar from the exact release commit and verify embedded versions and registered commands.
3. **Installed copy:** install only the candidate artifact into an isolated test location; do not overwrite `/Applications/CSSwitch.app` during development.
4. **Installed runtime:** use temporary HOME/data-dir and dynamic ports to verify Gateway ownership, one-click launch, reuse, stop, and reopen.
5. **Live provider:** when explicitly authorized, verify a real provider separately from loopback mocks and report model/tool compatibility precisely.
6. **Distribution:** verify code signature, notarization, Gatekeeper behavior, hashes, and the final uploaded artifact.
7. **Published release:** only after the public tag, release entry, assets, README, CHANGELOG, upgrade notes, and known limitations agree.

For upgrades from 0.4.3 or later, the candidate must reuse `~/.csswitch/sandbox/home/.claude-science` and leave existing Science organization/Skill data and legacy CSSwitch Skill store files untouched. External Skill trees, legacy inventory corruption, and provider Skill catalog availability must not affect startup.

No release, app replacement, tag, push, or remote-branch deletion is implicit in successful development tests.

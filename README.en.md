# CSSwitch

CSSwitch is a local configuration converter for Claude Science. It translates Science inference requests and connects them to your own model API, including DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, MiniMax, GLM, OpenRouter, relay providers, or custom compatible endpoints.

It is built for more than developers. You need Claude Science, a third-party API key, and the CSSwitch desktop panel: create a profile, make it active, then click "一键开始" (Start).

> The current app mainly targets macOS Apple Silicon. Because the app is not notarized yet, macOS may ask you to right-click and choose "Open" the first time.

> **0.4.4:** One-click startup no longer scans external Skills, reads legacy store/inventory, or reconciles deployments. Upgrades keep using `~/.csswitch/sandbox/home/.claude-science` without migrating, deleting, or overwriting existing Science data. See the [architecture contract](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Why CSSwitch exists

Claude Science is Anthropic's AI agent app for research and analysis workflows, including literature review, data processing, code execution, chart generation, and writing. By default, it depends on Claude login and Anthropic inference.

CSSwitch acts as a local runtime control plane:

- It starts Claude Science in an isolated sandbox.
- It runs third-party model mode in a separate local workspace without taking over your real Claude account.
- It forwards Science model requests to the provider you choose.
- It translates between Anthropic Messages API and OpenAI-compatible APIs when needed.
- It keeps an "Official Claude" mode so subscribers can switch back to the real Science app.

In short: CSSwitch is to Claude Science what CC Switch is to Claude Code, with additional desktop-app, isolated-workspace, and local-gateway management.

```text
Claude Science sandbox
  -> CSSwitch local proxy
  -> DeepSeek / Qwen / Kimi / MiniMax / GLM / OpenRouter / custom endpoint
```

## What it can do

**For everyday users**

- Manage multiple model profiles from a desktop panel instead of editing environment variables.
- Save multiple profiles for the same provider, such as different keys, models, or relay URLs.
- Verify a key before making a profile active; failed checks do not silently switch your active setup.
- Click "一键开始" (Start) to launch the proxy, prepare the sandbox, and open Science.
- Show the actual selected model name in Science instead of a vague `claude` or `opus` label.
- Switch back to "Official Claude" without interfering with your real Claude login.
- Reuse Science's persistent data-dir; Skill state is no longer a CSSwitch startup gate. In third-party mode, native Science Skill import/publish paths that depend on the Anthropic account catalog may be unavailable.

**For advanced users**

- Supports native Anthropic-compatible endpoints, OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible endpoints, and OpenAI Responses-compatible endpoints.
- Supports custom `base_url`, model names, and relay providers.
- Native Anthropic endpoints such as DeepSeek, Kimi, and MiniMax are passed through when possible to preserve tool use, thinking, and streaming behavior.
- Qwen and custom OpenAI endpoints are translated by the local proxy.
- Local config and logs make debugging and issue reports easier.

## Quick start

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [Claude Science](https://claude.com)
- A macOS Apple Silicon device
- A working third-party model API key
- No separate Python runtime is required; CSSwitch bundles its Rust inference gateway

1. Download the latest `CSSwitch_*.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](../../releases/latest).
2. Drag CSSwitch into Applications.
3. If macOS blocks the first launch, right-click the app and choose "Open".
4. Keep the top mode set to "第三方模型" (third-party model).
5. Click "+ 新建" (New), choose a provider, and enter your API key, model, and `base_url` when required.
6. Click "创建" (Create), then choose "设为当前" (Set active) on the profile.
7. After verification succeeds, click "一键开始" (Start).
8. CSSwitch starts the isolated Science instance and opens it in your browser.

To use Science with its official service configuration, switch to "官方 Claude" (Official Claude). CSSwitch will tear down the third-party proxy path and open the real Science app.

## Upgrading from an older version

Version 0.4.4 keeps the existing v2 configuration format and reuses `~/.csswitch/sandbox/home/.claude-science`, so existing Science organizations, projects, and Skills are not migrated or overwritten when Skill Manager is removed. Legacy CSSwitch Skill store/inventory files remain untouched but no longer participate in startup; external `~/.claude/skills` trees are no longer synchronized into Science.

For exact steps, backup locations, and rollback boundaries, see [Upgrade and rollback](./docs/upgrade-and-rollback.md).

## Supported model sources

| Source | API path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek | Native Anthropic endpoint | Default source; preserves thinking, tool use, and streaming as much as possible |
| Qwen | OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible endpoint | CSSwitch translates it into Anthropic format for Science |
| GLM | Anthropic-compatible endpoint | Editable default URL; choose or type a model |
| Xiaomi MiMo | Anthropic-compatible endpoint | Can be changed to plan-specific or regional endpoints |
| SiliconFlow | Anthropic-compatible endpoint | Choose or type a model |
| Kimi / Moonshot | Anthropic-compatible endpoint | Editable default URL; supports Kimi models |
| MiniMax | Anthropic-compatible endpoint | Editable default URL; supports MiniMax models |
| OpenRouter | Anthropic-compatible aggregation endpoint | Choose or type a model |
| Custom Anthropic | User-provided compatible endpoint | For private gateways, Claude-compatible relays, or local adapters |
| Custom OpenAI | User-provided OpenAI Chat Completions base root | The proxy appends `/chat/completions` and `/models` |
| Custom OpenAI Responses | User-provided OpenAI Responses base root | The proxy appends `/responses` and `/models` |

> If your URL is an `/anthropic` endpoint, choose "Custom Anthropic". If you choose "Custom OpenAI", enter an OpenAI-compatible base root such as `https://example.com/v1`, not an Anthropic endpoint.

## Status diagnostics and capability catalog

CSSwitch includes a read-only capability catalog for known provider, tool-use, and transport compatibility boundaries. Runtime diagnostics return rules matched by the current profile to explain how that configuration is handled.

This catalog is for diagnostics and observability. It does not mean every external provider, official hosted capability, signing state, or notarization state has been verified.

Status lights are local observations only. For example, the sandbox light is local HTTP health, not proof that the port has been identity-verified as the CSSwitch sandbox Science instance. `Doctor` skips the real `~/.claude-science` path by default; checking whether the real HOME path exists requires explicitly setting `CSSWITCH_DOCTOR_CHECK_REAL_HOME=1`.

## How it protects your real account

CSSwitch's core boundary is simple: third-party model mode keeps credentials, data directories, and proxy routing inside the sandbox. It does not take over your real Claude account.

- It does not copy, read, or modify real Claude login credentials, OAuth tokens, account state, or user data.
- The isolated Science instance uses its own HOME, ports, and data directory.
- Third-party API keys are stored in `~/.csswitch/config.json` with `0600` file permissions.
- Keys are not displayed in application logs, and the local gateway listens only on loopback.
- Official Claude mode tears down the third-party proxy path before handing you back to the real Science app.

## Current limitations

CSSwitch is not an official Claude service, and third-party model mode does not grant Anthropic account privileges. These are current architectural limits:

- Anthropic-hosted remote MCP services are unavailable, including `pubmed`, `clinical-trials`, `chembl`, `biorxiv`, and other `*.mcp.claude.com` services.
- Directory connectors, remote plugins, and cloud features that require real Claude account authorization may show session expired, unavailable, or skipped.
- Third-party models differ in tool use, long context, thinking, image, and streaming compatibility. Native Anthropic endpoints are usually more reliable than OpenAI translation paths.
- The macOS package is not notarized yet, so the first launch requires manual approval.
- The inference gateway is a bundled Rust sidecar; no runtime Python fallback is shipped.

Please report problems through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SuperJJ007/CSSwitch/issues).

## Languages

README languages currently available:

| Language | File |
|---|---|
| Simplified Chinese | [README.md](./README.md) |
| English | [README.en.md](./README.en.md) |

The desktop app UI is currently mainly Chinese. Multilingual README files do not mean the app UI already has an in-app language switch. If app i18n lands later, this section will say so explicitly.
